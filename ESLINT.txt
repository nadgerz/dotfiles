ESLint - Find and fix problems in your JavaScript code

https://eslint.org/

Based off a configuration file, ESLint will scan your code
and report on syntax/style errors.

It can also, optionally, attempt to automatically fix your
code to match the required configuration settings.

I am not going to reproduce the docs here, but at least
read this:

https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started


ESLint can be used globally across projects, but it is
recommended to use it on a per project/repo basis
because code that once worked fine (on a project that
is rarely touched) might break if the global configuration
changes.
