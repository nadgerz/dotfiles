This repository (here-on-in called 'repo') contains some
configuration files for a number of tools we will use everyday.

These are only example configuration files (the ones I use)
but you can fork this repo and modify to your taste.

If you work on a team, try to work towards a common agreement
for these settings.

It will make your life A LOT easier :)

These files are often called 'dotfiles' because their name
starts with a '.', which means they are hidden by default
in directory listings.

This is because once they are set we rarely need to see/change
them and by hiding them by default, we get cleaned directory
listings on a day-to-day basis.


The 5 tools we will be mentioning/configuring are:

eslint - Find and fix problems in your JavaScript code
prettier - opinionated code formatter
husky - git hooks made easy
lint-staged - Run linters against staged git files and don't let ðŸ’© slip into your code base!
pretty-quick - runs prettier on your changed files

There is a separate 'README' for each tool for the details
of configuring that specific tool.
