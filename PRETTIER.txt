prettier - opinionated code formatter

https://prettier.io/

Like ESLint, with prettier you set up a config file and
prettier will comment on (and optionally fix) your code.

In conjunction with ESLint they are a formidable team
in helping teams work together and stop arguing about style.

The team (finally :) ) set up a config of settings they agree on
and you never have to think about it again.

Both integrate into modent IDE's well, so that you can just save
a file and have it formatted and syntax checked immediately.

Like ESLint there is a core settings file and an ignore file.

Unlike ESLint, there are no overrides other than the one single
settings file.

The idea behind this is to stop a situation where the team agrees
on a setting and someone individually overrides that, making the
whole idea of prettier, pretty pointless. See what i did there? :)


Here is my .prettierrc file:

----- 8< ----- .prettierrc ----- >8 -----
{
  "semi": false,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "trailingComma": "all",
  "endOfLine": "auto",
}
----- 8< ----- .prettierrc ----- >8 -----



And my ignore file:

----- 8< ----- .prettierignore ----- >8 -----
*.log
.DS_Store
.build
.cache/
build/
coverage/
dist/
logs/
package-lock.json
public/
tmp/
----- 8< ----- .prettierignore ----- >8 -----

Many of the ignores are similar to ESLint for the same reasons... some
files there is no point in changing... they are either 3rd party files
or generated one that will just come back the same way.


Now in the case of the 5 overrides I chose for my .prettierrc file, these
are fairly common, but at the end, totally personal.
