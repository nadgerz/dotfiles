pretty-quick - runs prettier on your changed files

https://github.com/azz/pretty-quick

In a similar idea to lint-staged, this tool will just
run prettier on your changed files.

This saves a lot of pointless processing of file that
are already formatted correctly.

When we combine it with a tool like husky the development
process get's a lot simpler/more consistent.

$ npm install --save-dev prettier pretty-quick
